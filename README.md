Power BI Sales Analysis Project
- Cleaned Data using SSMS
- Saved data as CSV files so that Power BI can use them as data sources.
- Created Dashboard with multiple tabs (One for Customer Details Analysis, Sales Overview Analysis, Gender Analysis, Product Analysis)

Findings

- December always has the highest amount of sales (evident in 2022 and 2023)
- Although there are sales from all around the globe, no North American city makes it to the top 10 in sales.
- Seven out of the top 10 cities in sales are from Australia
